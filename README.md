Dear Teachable Team,

As requested, I've created a search application that takes a user's search query, hits the Ruby Gems search API endpoint, and displays the results in a list view with some added functionality (detailed below).

The application meets the following criteria:

-   It has a search box that lets users search for Ruby Gems.
-   It displays the results of the search in a list.
-   Each Gem has a button that lets users "save" and "unsave" Gems.
-   It has a way to view saved Gems, even after the browser window is refreshed (uses localStorage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

to install the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode as well as the proxy server.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Ruby Gems proxy API now runs at: http://localhost:5000

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
There are a couple of sample tests you will see. Make sure you start the proxy server in a separate window by running `node ./server` before starting tests.

## Constructive and kind feedback is very welcome!
